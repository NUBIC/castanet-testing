1. castanet-testing

Castanet[1] contains Rake tasks to start the Jasig CAS Server[2] and a CAS
proxy callback in a test environment.

This gem contains an adaptation of those tasks for use in other projects.

2. Requirements

* A Ruby environment: Ruby 1.9.3, JRuby 1.7.0, and Rubinius 2.0.0 are
  regularly tested
* curl(1)
* openssl(1)
* patch(1)
* test(1)
* GNU tar

3. Usage

In a Rakefile:

    require 'castanet/testing'

    Castanet::Testing::JasigServerTasks.new
    Castanet::Testing::CallbackServerTasks.new

This will install the following tasks:

    castanet:testing:jasig:start
    castanet:testing:jasig:waitall
    castanet:testing:jasig:cleanall
    castanet:testing:callback:start
    castanet:testing:callback:waitall
    castanet:testing:callback:cleanall

The start tasks can be used on their own or as part of a Procfile.  If used in
a Procfile, you may freely vary concurrency levels.  (Often, however, you'll
want just one server instance.)

All *Tasks classes have optional parameters.  See the class docs for more
information.
