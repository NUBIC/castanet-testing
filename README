1. castanet-testing

Castanet[1] contains Rake tasks to start the Jasig CAS Server[2] and a CAS
proxy callback in a test environment.

This gem contains an adaptation of those tasks for use in other projects.

2. Usage

In a Rakefile:

    require 'castanet/testing'

    Castanet::Testing::JasigServerTasks.new
    Castanet::Testing::CallbackServerTasks.new

This will install the following tasks:

    castanet:testing:jasig:download
    castanet:testing:jasig:prep  (=> download)
    castanet:testing:jasig:start (=> prep)
    castanet:testing:jasig:waitall
    castanet:testing:jasig:stopall

Of course, you may only install one of these tasks.

The start tasks can be used on their own or as part of a Procfile.  If used in
a Procfile, you may freely vary concurrency levels.  (Often, however, you'll
want just one server instance.)
